        The best college websites know how to make their features and tools work continually to further the institution’s success. A school-specific CMS like Morweb comes equipped with fundraising features such as donation page creation, recurring gift options, fundraising thermometers, and payment processing, so you can build both a beautiful and effective college website for fundraising.

Then, by leveraging additional tools like Double the Donation's matching gift software, you can add a widget to your donation pages that makes it easy for donors to determine their eligibility for this impactful corporate giving opportunity. Plus, when donors input information such as their email address during the giving process, the software automatically sends follow-up emails based on whether or not they’re eligible to submit a matching gift request to their company.
